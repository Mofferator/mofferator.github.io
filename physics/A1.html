		<p>
			Vectors can be resolved into the coordinate axes using trigonometry, this mean we can gain independent values of the vector
			for each of the cartesian directions. We do this by treating the vector itself as a hypotenuse of
			a right angled triangle, with the opposite and adjacent directions being in the directions
			of the coordinate axes (or paralled/perpendicular to a different plane if it's more convenient.
		</p>
		<p>
		Resolving vectors is very useful for calculations where we want to isolate the different direction of a vector, e.g. finding the vertical component of a velocity for
		 projectile calculations.
